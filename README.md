# SCS_RPC2
Discord Rich Presence plugin for ETS2 and ATS
___

Project is currently in a long term process of rebuilding using rust via bindings to the c++ telemetry sdk. Note that this is nowhere near my primary project.

Current roadmap:
- [ ] Wrap my head around bindgen and even rust for that matter
- [ ] Rewrite standing functionality using rust
  - [ ] Definitely rewrite data structure holding cities on a map
  - [ ] Ad. cities - have an automated process of extracting city names and locations directly from gamefiles
- [ ] Profit?
